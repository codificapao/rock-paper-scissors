# rock-paper-scissors
Project Overview

Objective: Develop an interactive JavaScript game where a player competes against the computer in Rock Paper Scissors.

Technologies: Javascript(for game logic).

Core Functionality

    1. User Input: The player input Rock, Paper, or Scissors, using a prompt that displays a dialog box with a message and allows the user to input data.
    2. Computer Choice: The program randomly generates the computer's choice.
    3. Rules Logic: JavaScript code determines the winner based on the classic rules:
        -Rock beats Scissors
        -Scissors beats Paper
        -Paper beats Rock
    4. Result Display: Clear feedback to the player indicating the winner of each round using console.log().

Steps to build
    1. JavaScript Logic:
        -Write functions to handle user input, computer choice generation, game logic (determining the winner), and updating the display using console.log.
